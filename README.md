# Digispark Dual Button Macro Pad

A tiny and configurable USB device that executes keyboard shortcuts when two physical buttons are pressed.

- Supports 2 external buttons via 3.5mm headphone jack (TRS)
- Remembers configuration in EEPROM
- Enter setup mode without reprogramming
- Built with a Digispark (ATtiny85)

## 🎮 Inspiration

This project was inspired by the [8BitDo Dual Super Buttons](https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-dual-super-buttons). The goal was to create a fully standalone version that works as a USB keyboard without needing the original 8BitDo controller.

## 🔧 Hardware

### Required components:
- 1x Digispark (ATtiny85)
- 1x TRS 3.5mm female headphone jack (3 vias)
- 2x normally open push-buttons
- Wires, solder, optional 3D-printed enclosure

### Pin connections:

```
       [ 3.5mm TRS Jack - Female ]
        _________________________
       | Tip   (BTN_A) -> P2    |
       | Ring  (BTN_B) -> P0    |
       | Sleeve (GND) -> GND    |
       |________________________|
```

### On the Digispark:
- BTN_A is connected to **P2** (digital pin 2)
- BTN_B is connected to **P0** (digital pin 0)
- GND goes to sleeve of jack

> No pull-up resistors needed — they are enabled internally via `INPUT_PULLUP`
